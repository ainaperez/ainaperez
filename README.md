- 👋 Hi, I’m @ainaperez
- 🌱 I’m currently in the middle of a Web and WebApplication development master. 
- 👀 I’m interested in developing meaningful projects. I am now still learning the basis of Web development 
 but in the future I would like to learn about cybersecurity and best practices to improve the sustainability of the internet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Web development projects, I am currently developing my own portofolio :)
